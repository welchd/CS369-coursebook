# CS369-notes

These notes were originally put together for the University of Auckland course CompSci 369 Computational Science which took in computational linear algebra and computational biology.

The course has refocused a little and is called Computational Biology.

The linear algebra part is based on slides by Georgy Gimel'farb, while the sections on Alignment to Parsmony based on the book Biological Sequence Analysis by Durbin et al. 2010. 
Other sections are incompletely referenced so presence in these notes is no claim of authorship.

The notes were compiled, collated and written by David Welch.
